Supply chain Tracking of Risk through Meteorological data (S.T.O.R.M.)

Welcome to this GitHub repository for tracking supply chain price fluctuations due to extreme weather events. Here are the key features:

1. This repository is designed to track the risks associated with supply chain price fluctuations caused by extreme weather events.
2. We have introduced a machine learning algorithm based on shape estimation to identify extreme weather events and price change points. We have also incorporated the inverse distance weighting method to assess the relationship between extreme weather events and price fluctuations.
